# Homework 1 Repo

This repo houses all of my code files for Econ/HLTH 470, Homework 1, Spring 2026. These files all run in Open OnDemand. To recreate the final PDF, follow these instructions:

1. Run the 'data-build' notebook. There are two versions of this notebook, one using R code and one using Python. Both are designed to be run within a Python environment, just for consistency. Running either notebook will save two files into the 'data/output' folder, a 'plan_data.csv' and a 'service_area.csv' file. These files are slightly cleaned-up versions of the raw data.

2. The actual answers and analysis are in the 'hwk1-answers.qmd' (for R) or 'hwk1-answers-py.qmd' (for Python) scripts. These are quarto markdown files (qmd) that function very similarly to a Jupyter Notebook in that they have markdown alongside code blocks in the same file. The .qmd files call the 'plan_data.csv' and 'service_area.csv' from 'data/output'. You can't run the .qmd files directly. Instead, you need to open the terminal, navigate to your hwk1 project folder, and then type 'run-quarto render hwk1-answers.qmd' for R or 'run-quarto render hwk1-answers-py.qmd' for Python. 'run-quarto' is a wrapper command that allows us to initiate quarto from Open OnDemand.

Note: Within the Open OnDemand environment, you can't run any of the individual code blocks of the qmd files. To effectively build the qmd files on your own, I would start with a Jupyter notebook first, that way you can run each code block and ensure it's doing what you want. Then, if you choose, you can move that over to a qmd file. Let's say your Jupyter Notebook is titled 'hwk1-answers.ipynb', then you can convert that to a qmd file from the terminal using 'run-quarto convert hwk1-answers.ipynb' This will create a new file called 'hwk1-answers.qmd'. Within that qmd file, you can then add YAML and other elements, knowing that your code blocks themselves will execute properly when rendered.

Note Note: What's the benefit of this extra step? Converting your notebook to .qmd before converting to PDF is basically the difference between handing in a raw lab log and a finished report. Jupyter's direct PDF export usually looks like a "save as PDF" from a browser. The page breaks are awkward, code overflows off the side, etc. By moving to .qmd, you get actual control over the layout. On top of just "it looks better", qmd also allows for automatic table and figure referencing: instead of manually typing "See Figure 3" (and then having to re-number and re-type it every time you move a graph around), you just tag your figures and tables, and Quarto handles the numbering for you. It strips away all the background "noise" from the notebook and uses a proper typesetting engine to make the final document look like a professional paper rather than an image of code blocks.
